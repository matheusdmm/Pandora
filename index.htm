            <h3>The modular and self contained webserver!</h3>
            <p>This project was built with Python 3 and uses basic library to handle files within the Pandora folder, it can access it through localserver and via localhost too. The example files are made with Foundation and shows a very basic usage of the funcionality, with javascript enabled.</p>
            <p>Lets take a dive into it.</p>
            </div>

          <h5>How it works?</h5>
          <!-- Grid Example -->

          <div class="grid-x grid-padding-x">
            <div class="large-12 cell">
              <div class="primary callout">
                <p><strong>It's a self contained webserver!</strong> So you just need to put it in the main project folder and the code will access all the itens within it, respecting the hierarchy, just like magic!.</p>
              </div>
            </div>
          </div>
          <div class="grid-x grid-padding-x">
            <div class="large-12 cell">
              <div class="primary callout">
                <p>Very little codebase to follow and run, it means that it's very easy to modify and make it suits your project in any way.</p>
              </div>
            </div>
            <div class="large-12 cell">
              <div class="primary callout">
                <p>And it also means that if you're not primarily a WebDev, the chances that you dont have something like Apache or Nginx and chances are you dont wanna mess around with another toolset in your sistem just to test and deploy a small site for any purpose you want, Pandora came right into this. <strong>So is this is it! Take a look and deploy your projects!</strong><</p>
