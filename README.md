## Pandora Selfhosted
This project started with Python 3 and have been refactored to GO! and then returned from ashes to Python again because more practicall to change the code to specific usage without the need to recompile it. It handles and serve files within the Pandora folder following any given structure. 

It can be accessed through localhost and/or wi-fi. 

It can handle a file transfer protocol too and you can make a little file host inside your network, to transfer files from one machine to another or even stream media now.

The new example files are made with Foundation and shows a very basic usage of the funcionality, and you can use it to learn HTML and CSS without worry about setup a specific server, it's usefull specially if you're still learning.
